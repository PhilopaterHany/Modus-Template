# Modus-Template
- Responsive HTML &amp; CSS Webpage !
- You can view the template's PSD file through this [link](https://www.graphberry.com/item/modus-single-page-portfolio-psd-template), It is free !
- Maybe I'll add some JavaScript later.
- Works well on all devices.
- Took around 15 hours.
- I considered it as a practice material to apply what I have learned in HTML5 and CSS3.
- You can view it live through this [link](https://philopaterhany.github.io/Modus-Template/).
- I hope you like it.
