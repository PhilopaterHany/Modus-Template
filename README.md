# Modus-Template

-   Responsive HTML &amp; CSS Webpage !
-   You can view the template's PSD file through this [link](https://www.graphberry.com/item/modus-single-page-portfolio-psd-template), It is free !
-   Works well on all devices.
-   Took around 15 hours.
-   I considered it as a practice material to apply what I have learned in HTML5, CSS3 and a bit of JavaScript.
-   You can view it live through this [link](https://philopaterhany.github.io/Modus-Template/).
-   I hope you like it.
